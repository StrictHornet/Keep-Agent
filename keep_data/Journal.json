A void I fill with drugs money alcohol and women. No matter how hard I work to fill it I get to this moment right here. In this moment I feel sunken and alone. Why one may ask? Because in all the excesses of filling up the void the void has only grown bigger. How can I address this? I\u2019m yet to find out. It\u2019s a heavy load I hate to carry. It\u2019s the load of a discontent life. I say so because thinking of my accomplishments rn will cheer me up but I don\u2019t want to because my dreams shadow mere accomplishments. So what I do instead is go out in sorrow and drink the night away. Women can\u2019t make me happy. Drugs only space me out. Alcohol works but has me incapacitated for a day. How can I fill this void. How can I feel.  How can I love. How can I love. How can I love. How will I live. Why don\u2019t I just breathe? Is there anybody like me?\n\n18:37\nI remove people from my life so consistently. I never allow the imperfections of others, yet, I judge people who do so just like myself. Maybe there\u2019s truth in the saying; the things we don\u2019t like are a projection of our inner selves. I say all this wanting to go out to fill the void then to cut off the persons or people who have helped fill that void temporarily.  In return making a larger void out of not lack but of the repeated and further validated inability to truly value another. If I get a girlfriend will I love her? If I get a friend will I love him? If I go out today and have a blast will I remember it? If I stay in and contemplate will I elevate? Feelings are so concrete yet in this society they seem ephemeral. In the life of a man they seem feather weight. All I really want is to love someone. To value them. To miss them. To desire them. To desire them and no one else. This lack of desire has haunted me. The attempt to love has burdened me. It mustn\u2019t be feminine.  It mustn\u2019t be masculine. I just want to feel. A friendly laugh of a friend I value. A hug from a companion I would love to hug again. A kiss from a woman I truly love. A family to call my own. A reason to not be so out of love. A reason to not be out of touch. A reason to want to be touched. A reason to want to procreate. A reason to want to elevate. \n\n19:19\nIt is fear.  A challenge is a door you open. I\u2019m afraid to open the door to solace. The door to emotionlessness.\n\n10 October 2025 - Friday\nThis is a summary of the days spent with Mayowa, concluding with Egbe and Nemo.\nMayowa came on the 8th of October. I was reluctant to give him my address but I did. We caught up then decided to go out at night. We went to the underground garage at enclave to use my Chevrolet Cruze LT MA13VYL. Unluckily the car didn't start so we walked to Memory Box. Upon arriving therewe did the normal, we talked, he flirted with girls then we came back home after and I went to sleep with Kurdistan. The next day I decided to take Mayowa on an adventure to speak with Ollie Ryan an inidvidual I met at a networking event with whom I decided to provide building optimisation services in conjunction with. Mayowa canme as my consultant but not before we explored Croydon trying to fix his laptop and we saw the cops searching for someone who we also though and if I can recall walk out from a store right behind the cops wearing a black 2 piece hoodie tracky combo with white threads. We then went to BlackMils Black Horse road in North London to meet with ollie where Mayoo played his role very well. He acted like  busy consukltant dropping the fewest of gems and sticking to utter arrogance as we agreed even waving me aweay withouyt looking me in the face. After what was a succesful experience with I and Mayo feeling rejuvenated we decided to hit up SOho per kurdistans advice. We walked round, spoke to some girls at the John Snow bar where there is a monument to the well which played a key role in Londons Cholera Outbreak, we got beers. We then went to 30 Dean street where karaoke played and Mayowa thought he had met his catch. We then went to Simmons Bar where we vibeddd for lack of better terms with the DJ teasing us with Afro beats; Shout out best DJ in London. We then went back to 30 Dean street after which we went to Be At One and I pulled a Hatrick in 3 mins with this young fine thing tryiong to copulate with me right on the street. We then went back to Simmons where the Dj lit it up and the rest was a blur. We got home tired and prepared for Friday.\n\nFriday was the day we were meant to meet up with Nemo. Mayowa was expected to go home buyt he stayed, gladly. Egbe came through first but after we picked up Nemo from Clapham Junction after he had travelled round London and against my wishes we used a black cab back to Croydonb which we got scammed into paying 57 pounds. With my last cash I bough Tequila, we picked up a bagand the stage was set for what wiull be our most transformative experience yet. \n\nThe soul that has the longest ladder and reaches down deepest \u2014 the most comprehensive soul, which can run and stray and roam farthest within itself; the most necessary soul that plunges joyously into chance; the soul that, having being, dives into becoming; the soul that has, but wants to want and will; the soul that flees itself and catches up with itself in the widest circles; the wisest soul that folly exhorts most sweetly; the soul that loves itself most, in which all things have their sweep and countersweep and ebb and flood\n\nThis was the energy I felt. We had a couple pours of tequila, a couple drags of Igbeaux and a couple laughs at each other. We went to the rooftop talked, praised and enjoyed. Upon coming back into the room a conversation erupted. I am not certain how but I will detail as below:\n\n\n-Girls, explaining why I play the game and how everything is a game\nI was stating that like video games you stop playing upon picking up the controller you become rusty. How being good at video games probably help me gamify life and how after being my Fifa self with women I have failed to drop the controller cause although its a useless game with no benefits it was a real game invoilving real people. Using the be at one night hatrick as proof and Mayoo backing me making me remeber the looks on the faces of the audience with Mayo saying its all me.\n\n-Egbe trying to understand my philosphy on the game of life\nEgbe initially didn't understad this so I had to use the analogy of how good he knew I was in FIFA to help him really lock into what I was saying by how I had gamified some aspects of life such as networking events and he finally unbderstood,. the outcome of that was him getting elevated to a frequemncy I dont think he had experienced before becauase as the intelligent man he is he began to see how he was losing xp by not playing it all as a game then he locked in became emotional and a sermon was started.\n\n-My life experiences and How I had been there \nI went on to discuss how myself had driven me to experience life which is was and will be a primary pillar of my understabding as all ,my understanding is goteen mostly from experience. I showed them ascaron my head which is the furthest extreme on one side and my participation in the church which is an extreme on the opposit side. I also hinted at why so much had been heard about me; not because I was worth discussing but becauyse I had lived.\n\n-Pointing out how everyone is an extension of the other \nI went on to point out how we were all gathered in that room as they all had features of me which I had learned from them so I was an extension of themselves in someway and they were an extension of me as well.\n\n-We all understanding it was a sermon and we were in the presence of life \nIt started with Egbe being emotional then I started beating m,y hands two right fingers on the palm of my keft hand embodying an african priest. Explaining hwo I want to preach not the serons opf the christian BUT THE SERMONS OF LIFE\n\n-Nemo asking me what I want and my response of not being able to word it\nNemo then posed the questionb to me. What is my Purpose? Who are you? What do you want? I simply said words are trivial the real answer to that question cannot be put into words. Realness cause hes that much real of my guy. I couldn't lie to him in words. Days after writing this upon reflection I stand correct as words can hint to things but something so real for someone so real cannot be put in words. Sorry.\n\n-Nemo experiences of the world leading to DOing what is required of you\nNemo then hinted at how from his experiences with the 1% he learned that life in summary can be summarised into doing what is required of you. Something I was proud to hear.\n\n-Me stating that our consciousness beckons -  Become who you are\nHowever I very quickly counteracted his saying by stating from my perspective life is about becoming who you are\n\n-Egbes Prayer, Request and Tears\nNemo asked, Princewill what is yourt wish>? I was gonna answer but Egbe made a wish and requested I never speak of it to which I agreed and him knowing how real I am. He broke into tears. Liuttkle did we know Egbe Nemo I and Mayo had experienced something ethereal as Nemos purpose and wish was fulfilled through Egbes participation, Mayowas taying, His existence and my persistence. \n\n-Thinking with the end in mind - Nemos Book Saturday Morning\nThe next morning Nemo showed me a book he wrote as a child. It had two simple requests\nBegin with the end in mind\nAlways think with the end in mind\nThen I realised that life really is intertwined and we are all here experiencing an experience we would never understand. They grew but so did I. My key takeaway was/is Be. Be. Be. Be. Be. Be. Be because you are God. Be because you are you. Be!\n\n---\nSupporting Writeups:\n\u201cWhat does your conscience say? \u2014 'You should become the person you are'.\u201d - exposition\nIn order to become this person, that you are, you must for the longest time be the person that you are NOT, you must diverge and de-tour yourself from the path, which you belonged to, the most; you have to seek in every explanation and every disguise a way out of \"becoming yourself\", you must do everything you can to \"NOT\" become \"yourself\" as a FIXED UNIT, as something predictable.\nYour conscience speaks from the depths and says to you: \"I shall not be someone else, I shall \"become myself\"; but in order to \"become myself\", I first have to create this \"self\" - I cannot borrow a self from someone else or take upon myself a self which has already been created\". Thus, your real task becomes to create yourself and in your creation of your self become this self.\nThis self you would then create from your own taste of good and bad, high and low, sweet and sour, and everything which speaks to your soul and which makes you shudder. You have only become the person that your conscience and desire spoke of when you cannot go any longer - when you have reached the top of the ladder on which you were to climb to yourself. The prize at the end of the rainbow is merely to own yourself, to have created yourself, to have become yourself.\n\nTry to reconcile the ideologies do what is required of you and become who you are wrt becoming who you are is what is required of you and if doing what is required of you is becoming who you are\nThis is a fascinating philosophical puzzle about duty, authenticity, and self-realization. Let me work through the reconciliation:\nThe apparent tension:\n\"Do what is required of you\" suggests external obligation, social roles, duty imposed from outside\n\"Become who you are\" suggests internal authenticity, self-discovery, realizing your inherent nature\nThe reconciliation:\nThese can be unified if we recognize that what is \"required\" isn't arbitrary external imposition, but rather the demands that arise from your own nature and circumstances. Here's how:\nFrom one direction: If becoming who you are is what's required of you, then your duty is self-realization. The requirement isn't external conformity but rather the obligation to actualize your potential. You're \"required\" to become yourself in the sense that failing to do so would be a betrayal of your existence.\nFrom the other direction: If doing what's required leads to becoming who you are, then external demands become the forge for self-discovery. Your duties, responsibilities, and the resistance of reality shape and reveal your character. You discover who you are through engagement with what's demanded.\nThe synthesis: Perhaps there's no real distinction. The deepest requirements are those that align with your nature\u2014what Nietzsche might call amor fati, loving your fate. When you're doing what's truly required (not just socially expected), you're expressing your authentic self. And becoming who you are isn't navel-gazing but engaging fully with your actual situation and its demands.\nThe reconciliation dissolves the dualism: requirement and authenticity aren't opposed but mutually constituting.\n\n\u201cMutually constituting\u201d means that two or more things create or define each other \u2014 they exist through their relationship, not separately.\nIn simpler terms:\nEach one shapes the other, and neither would be what it is without the other.\n💡 Examples:\nCulture and identity are mutually constituting \u2014 your culture shapes who you are, and who you are helps shape your culture.\n\nTheory and practice are mutually constituting \u2014 ideas influence actions, and actions refine ideas.\n\nIt\u2019s often used in philosophy, sociology, and cultural studies to describe reciprocal influence \u2014 a two-way process of creation or definition.\n\nReciprocal influence is the idea that two or more things, such as a person and their environment, mutually affect each other in a continuous cycle. It is a core concept in psychology known as reciprocal determinism, a theory by Albert Bandura that states behavior, personal factors (like thoughts and beliefs), and the environment all influence one another. \n\n\"So also you have sorrow now, but l will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.\"\nThis is John 16:22, from Jesus's farewell discourse to his disciples before his crucifixion.\nThe verse captures a profound movement from present sorrow to future joy\u2014a joy that's described as permanent and untakeable. It connects beautifully to your previous question about duty and becoming.\nThe reconciliation dimension:\nIn this passage, what is \"required\" of the disciples is to endure sorrow, loss, and apparent abandonment. Yet this very requirement\u2014bearing the grief of separation\u2014is paradoxically the path to becoming who they truly are: people of indestructible joy.\nThe sorrow isn't avoided or negated; it's transformed. They must go through the requirement (the suffering, the loss) to reach the becoming (the joy that no one can take away). The duty and the destiny are the same path.\nThe untakeable quality:\nWhat makes this joy \"untakeable\" is that it's no longer dependent on external circumstances. It's not the joy of avoiding suffering, but the joy that emerges on the other side of necessary suffering\u2014a joy rooted in something deeper than circumstance.\nThis parallels what you were asking about: when doing what's required (enduring the sorrow) becomes the very means of becoming who you are (someone with permanent joy), the distinction between obligation and authenticity collapses. The requirement reveals the self; the self fulfills the requirement.\nIs this connection you were exploring\u2014how duty and authenticity might be unified through necessary passage?\n\n---\n\n16 October 2025 - Thursday\nI waited 6 days to write that up.

We did very well.\n\n28 October 2025 - Tuesday\nGod is good all the time. All the time God is good. God created man in his own image and man is creating AI to his own likeness.

Both blonde, both just by looking into their eyes said all than words could say. I have hacked this game. Went 2 for 2.\n\n13/1/2026 13 January 2026 - Wednesday\nWoke up and read the bible after asking God to help me put him first. 2 days no masturbation. 3 actually tonight makes it 4!\n\n2/5/26 5 February 2026 \nToday I woke up and grabbed my phone and that action alone really determined how I woke up or the mindstate i woke up in. I woke up annoyed at the world order. Only through talking with Mayowa did I realise this. Hence never again will I wake up and not attend to myself first or have something positive to start the day. \n\n2/6/26 6 February 2026\nMy priority in life is helping Nigeria. My second priority is money. My third priority is PhD. My family and generational wealth are a priority ar well. I prioritise a fun and fulfilled life. I need a wife. I want to travel and explore america. \n\n2/7/26 7 February 2026\nI don't know why I go out every weekend. It is not the pussy. Let me use chat gpt to find out. I am chasing connection in a disposable manner when what I want is true connection. \n\n2/11/26 11 February 2026 \nI am chill rn. I woke up early and have been productive. I only wonder, would I ever know why I lived? \n\n2/23/26 23 February 2026 Monday\nWrite. I am in the middle of feeling better and regret. I have been wasteful. God help me recover.
