{"color":"DEFAULT","isTrashed":false,"isPinned":false,"isArchived":true,"textContent":"Hello friends,\nWelcome to the Designing Your Life (DYL) book group (stoners edition). This book basically helps you find what you truly enjoy doing in life and how you can utilize the joy from that in leading a joyous life. It makes you ask questions so you can key into things that bring you happiness, things you weren't even aware of. Before I read this book and before I ever popped a pill of MDMA I thought only video games, photography and computer science interested me. After reading the book I realized I truly loved engaging people in meaningful conversations and helping them learn from themselves. I hope through this book we all find the things that make us happy.\n\n\n**NB for this group**\nFirstly, this is a safe space with zero tolerance to any form of negative energy whether in the form of condescension or neglect to engage respectfully with other participants. Anybody found guilty of bad vibes would be ostracized either through mutual agreement or moderation. Even moderators, like myself can and would be ostracized if found guilty of bad vibes.\n\nSecondly, this group is above its threshold of 7 participants so feel free to dropout at any point if you feel you won't be able to keep up. However, if you make it through the book... expect to have a different perception of yourself as well as your environment. \n\nLastly, this is a fun space. Pardon the seriousness in my writing, I just finished writing GRE so my writing get as e be right now. Most of the exercises in the book are fun, such as mind mapping, drawing and brainstorming. Don't expect a boring over 50 sort of study group. If you're into that sorry to disappoint you.\n\nI will now take any and all questions, regardless of if it aligns with this discussion.\n","title":"","userEditedTimestampUsec":1611758444093000,"createdTimestampUsec":1611755257553000,"textContentHtml":"<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Hello friends,<\/span><\/p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Welcome to the Designing Your Life (DYL) book group (stoners edition).
